About Dataset_Preprocessing
============
So This project are fully work on the images(datset) to preprocess usnig C++ and Python.
C++ that i used take the suitbale information like that dataset path, how many images you want to display it, etc. but main role are the c++ to create command to create txt pixles file by using python. C++ are used to display and create the commad for python. the txt file will created in pixel folder. perticular in dog folder are ther with 1000 images so that one dog folder images will preprocess in one dog.txt file will 1000 lines and each lines means one image in given preprocess form. So that is the my mini project for https://github.com/AlwaysDhruv/Image-Classification-CPP. that i created separately for better understanding for me and everyone can watch and understand also. how ai and ml architectures and algorithms works by implementing in real word problem.

Thanks!!
